## CROM aplication: matlab code and raw data
CSV file contains: Sample number, timestamp, device ID, X, Y, Z, qW, qX, qY, qZ, aX, aY, aZ. The timestamp follows the HH:mm:ss.ffff format. <br />
The device is identified with a single letter: H for the HMD and T for the tracker. <br />
X, Y, Z correspond to the device position in the space; qW, qX, qY, qZ to the quaternion; and aX (Pitch), aY (Yaw), aZ (Roll) are the Euler angles.
